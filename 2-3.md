More decoding vm boot 

The freelist
- the kernel's inventory of available physical memory

```
freelist_head = pa2kva((void*)&freelist_nodes[0]);
freelist_tail = pa2kva(&freelist_nodes[MAX_TEST_PAGES-1]);

freelist_nodes[i].next = pa2kva(&freelist_nodes[i+1]);

```
- store all pointers with virtual addresses bcz we are in m-mode right now


```
freelist_nodes[i].addr = DRAM_BASE + (MAX_TEST_PAGES + random)*PGSIZE;
```
- MAX_TEST_PAGES * PGSIZE is 4MB -- this just assumes the kernel physical memory wil ltake up 4MB, arbitrarily. We don't need to change this
